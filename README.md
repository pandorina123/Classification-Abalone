#### Classification of Abalone

#### Project Objective
Abalone is a category of marine snails, which are part of the staple diet in several coastal communities. As they get harvested, it is crucial to identify the adults and infants to prevent overfarming of the young ones, which could push the species to extinction. A classification system to distinguish between adult and infant abalones is of significant environmental importance.

This project aims to classify abalones into adults and infants based on physical measurements. Three different models were tuned and tested, and the best performing model was used to predict user input data.

#### Dataset Information
The dataset was obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone). The data was stored in a text file and imported into the Python environment using pandas for analysis.

#### Models Used
- Model 1: KNN
- Model 2: SVC
- Model 3: DT

The best-performing model was selected based on accuracy and applied to predict abalone classification from user inputs.

#### How to Run
1. Load the dataset using the provided script.
2. Run the classification models on the dataset.
3. Use the best model to classify new abalone data.
